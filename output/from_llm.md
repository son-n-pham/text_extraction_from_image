You can see my eyes above and behind you if you need to know who I am, but don't look at me until you have finished reading this message. My name is not important; it does n ot matter what country or state you are in, nor do i care how old you are. We all share the same pain and suffering that we endure each day with our families and loved ones. We must all remember those who died at Pearl Harbor on Decemb er 7th,1941 thoug h most of us didn't even know them by name back then . Let us never forget to be grateful for what we have in this world whether it is freedom, peace or the opportunity to earn a living and raise our families.Let us all come together as a nation and make t he sacrifices that must be made if we are to ensure that such an atrocity will never occur again. I pray that God blesses you and your family this Christmas and New Years.

Twilight filled the grief consumed corridor, cleared of any sign indicating only train of sound, able to be heard. A man stood in the colorless plane, unable to move or think. Attempting to imagine a world of life and luxury was eternally out of reach, like a goal with no prize. The mind was a fascinating entity, its capabilities endless, yet also enhanced with a limit, like a long string tied to a burning math, the power of imagination just needed to be cut loose.



The man who stood in the corridor seemed to be a representation of thought, yet unable to be cut free, with unrippable rope. Like a candle in the head, the corridor could be brought back to a flourishing future, sunshining a golden treasure, all returned with just a flicker of fire. Yet it could also be blown out with a single dull thought of mind. Doubt and demons could chase the man out, but only if you don't believe in yourself.



The man could cry, drowned in tears or have some fun with the chase, overflowing with cheer. Yet fear, fright, and disencouragement could overcome both fates, underestimating the power of oversight. You could think something easy, but turns out to be hard, like smoke in the corridor, slowly overcoming all.



Though each little representation of the mind is different in each way, remember a string, candle, or smoke could help unlock your minds true potential. You could write a fable, imagine an epic fight. For imagination is endless and its power is true.

Title: Twilight filled the grim corridor, cleared of any sign indicating life.



Body Text:

The wind whistled through the towering pillars creating a train of sound that could be heard.

A man stood in the colorless plane, unable to move or think.

Attempting to imagine a world and luxury was eternally out of reach; like a goal with no prize. The mind was a fascinating entity yet unable to escape it.



The corridor seemed to be cut free from imagination tied to a burning match, where power of thought could lead the man who stood in one head, perhaps back brought but only to find himself lost and alone.

He returned home on fire; there could be a golden treasure within. Doubt and demons might blow out with an untrustworthy belief.



The corridor seemed like a chase that he could not have fun with tears of cheer instead over-flowing. Yes, the power of imagination overwhelmed everything until it was hard to believe life's capabilities endless yet enhanced by one thought or smoke.

Though each little representation of the mind is different in every way; remember—a string can unlock your true potential.
