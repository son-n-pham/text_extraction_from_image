colour, light or life. The wind whistled through the towering pillars creating the only train of sound, able to be heard.

A man stood in the colourless plane, unable to move or think.

Attempting to imagine a world of life and luxury was eternally out of reach, like a goal with no prize. The mind was a fascinating entity, its capabilities endless yet also enhanced with a limit, like a long string tied to a burning match, the power of imagination just needed to be cut loose.

The man who stood in the corridor seemed to be a representation of thought, yet unable to be cut free, with unrippable rope. Like a candle in a head, the corridor could be brought back to a flourishing future, sunshining a golden treasure, all returned with just a flicker of fire. Yet it could also be blown out with a single dull thought of mind. Doubt and demons could chase the man out, but only if you don't believe in yourself.

The man could cry, drowned in tears or have some fun with the chase, overflowing with cheer. Yet fear, fright and discouragement could overcome both fates, understimating the power of oversight. You could think something easy, but turns out to be hard, like smoke in the corridor it slowly overcomes all.

Though each little representation of the mind is different in each way, remember a string, candle or smoke could help unlock your minds true potential. You could write a fable, imagine an epic fight. For imagination is endless and its power is true.

s to help the pilot maintain situati on awareness and visibili ty during takeoff a nd landing. The instrument s can also be used as assist ance with taxiing and to identify the approach path.In addition the pilot must also make use of visual ref erences during flight such as clouds, birds and other aircraft that can provide useful data about wind speed and direction.Flight training.The learning process for flight training can be divided into three main stages . The first stage is known as ground school. In this phase, t he student learns the basic principles of aviation and general knowledge of aerobatics. This is generally done in a classroom setting. Then the pilot progresses to takeoff and landi ng exercises under supervision. During the third stage of flight training the student is taught how to manage a plane during flight operations including how to handle instruments while flying . For private pilots this can be a long and difficult learning process.The flight school owner who teaches you how to fly will also help you learn t he basics on ground school as well as during your actual lessons. The f light school owner will guide you through the entire learning process and will also give you a certificate of competency at the end of the course which is required by all aviation authorities.
