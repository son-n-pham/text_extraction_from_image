The text in the image is handwritten and appears to be a passage about the power of imagination, written on a piece of white paper.

**Text:**

*   "Twilight filled the grief consumed corridor, cleared of any sign indicating"
*   "colour, light or life. The wind whistled through the towering pillars creating the only train of sound, able to be heard."
*   "A man stood in the colourless plane, unable to move or think."
*   "Attempting to imagine a world of life and luxury was eternally out of reach, like a goal with no prize. The mind was a fascinating entity, its capabilities endless, yet also enhanced with a limit, like a long string tied to a burning math, the power of imagination just needed to be cut loose."
*   "The man who stood in the corridor seemed to be a representation of thought, yet unable to be free, with unrippable rope. Like a candle in a head, the corridor could be brought back to a flourishing future, sunshining a golden treasure, all returned with just a flicker of fire."
*   "Yet it could be blown out with a single dull thought of mind. Doubt and demons could chase the man out, but only if you don't believe in yourself."
*   "The man could cry, drowned in tears or have some fun with the chase, overflowing with cheer. Yet fear, fright and discouragement could overcome both fates, undermining the power of oversight."
*   "You could think something easy, but turns out to be hard, like smoke in the corridor it slowly overcomes all."
*   "Though each little representation of the mind is different in each way, remember a string, candle or smoke could help unlock your minds true potential. You could write a fable, imagine an epic fight. For imagination is endless and its power is true."
